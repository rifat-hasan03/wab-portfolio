And you need the right aptitude, which is probably a combination of genetics and childhood nurture. And you need luck, if you want fame on top of your skill.Not everyone can win a gold at the Olympics, even if they practice and train. The winners also have a slight innate edge. Maybe that edge is shared by the top 5-10 competitors, but it's there.</p>
